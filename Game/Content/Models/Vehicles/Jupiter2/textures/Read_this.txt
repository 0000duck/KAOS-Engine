   For all those "Lost in Space" fans out there, I ( kind of ) proudly present:


   Jupiter 2 Spaceship in 3-D ! ! !
  -----------------------------------

  Rev. 4   11/20/05

  Note: this model was done COMPLETELY FROM MEMORY and is probably inaccurate in
 many ways, but what the heck, it's free, right ?
 I used Anim8or to create the structures and add lots of internal content, so you can
 use Poser to use it for a complete scene stage for your own space epic ( Like the original
 Jupiter 2, this one has lots of camera room ! )

  All you need now is a robot.

  Unlike the other downloadable Jupiter 2 model to be found on the internet, this one has
 three decks ( not one ) and is more the proper scale from the TV series, and includes 
 the chariot, The lander, crash couches,  dining lounge, and control cockpit with computer
 banks, not to mention the elevator and stasis tubes. Many of it's inaccuracies probably
 stem from the need to extrapolate functions of various parts, and needing to allocate
 room for the individual items. For instance, I enclosed the Chariot and Lander in
 transparent "drop tubes" on the lower deck to preserve functionality. That may not be
 authentic, but it sure looks good in rendering !
  Also, textures can be assigned to any of the element materials, making the whole model
 customizable for render purposes.

  Bonus: Galaxy & Space background scene in JPEG format.
    Feature: plaster it on a background, or cube bigger than the viewing scene. Also usable
             as a "SkyDome" template.   



  Rev. 4:  Fixed the landing gear, added morphs to retract the landing gear, added landing gear
      bay doors which are closable, and added a morph to close the airlock door. Added basic
      texturing, and re-scaled to fit poser figures. Also converted to figure state.


  Lost in Space and Poser are trademarked respectively. No association with these
 companies or individuals is implied.
