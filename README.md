KAOS-ENGINE
====

Welcome to my final year university project. I have come to consider this as a testbed in which to experiment and learn OpenGL. 

The goal for this engine is to implement a a nice and declarative interface for accessing the graphics pipeline. 
Initially targeting opengl through experimentation and heavy prototyping.
